                    </div>
                </div>

Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="step-container">

                        <span clas="step-text">Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <span clas="step-text">As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="step-container">

                        <span clas="step-text">Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
